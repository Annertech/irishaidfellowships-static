          <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>My name is Rumbidzai Gandiwa, and I am originally from Zimbabwe. I am currently in the third year of my PhD in Marketing and International Business at Munster Technological University in Cork. Education is a true passion of mine, which is reflected in the various roles I take on. Despite being a full-time student, I also work part-time as a lecturer and academic tutor. Additionally, I collaborate with the National Student Engagement Programme as a Student Quality Assurance Reviewer and Student Trainer, where I contribute to higher education policy reviews and leadership training for student leaders in Ireland.</p>
<p>Prior to coming to Ireland to take part in the Ireland Fellows Programme, I earned a BSc in International Marketing from Chinhoyi University of Technology (Zimbabwe), graduating with a First-Class Honours in 2016. In addition, I completed several professional courses, including a Certificate in Digital Marketing and a Certificate in Strategic Public Relations, further enhancing my expertise in the field. I worked as a Graduate Trainee and Public Relations Officer at Zimbabwe Power Company, based in the Harare office. In this role, I contributed to various projects, primarily related to major power developments undertaken by the company. Additionally, during my tenure at Zimbabwe Power Company, I was seconded to the Ministry of Energy and Power Development, where I worked with the ministerial task force on crisis communications for a short-term assignment.</p>
<p>I am honoured to have been a Fellow of the Ireland Fellows Programme, through which I completed an MA in Public Relations with New Media at Munster Technological University (formerly Cork Institute of Technology). I chose this programme because it closely aligned with my passion for communications and my desire to advance my studies in the field. The programme was ideally suited to both my educational and professional goals, offering the international exposure necessary to enhance my career. With a strong emphasis on practical, hands-on learning, the course covered key areas of Public Relations while equipping me with essential digital and practical skills. Upon completing the course, I felt that the master's degree had opened countless doors for me, providing not only a stronger professional network but also lasting friendships, and invaluable international exposure and experience. These are all aspects I am deeply grateful for.</p>
<p>I will always remember the warmth and kindness of the people in Ireland, as well as the country’s breathtakingly beautiful green landscapes. I was struck by how warm, helpful, and friendly the Irish people are. While not necessarily surprising, their kindness really stood out to me and inspired me to be a better, kinder person. The constant rain and cloudy weather in Ireland took me by surprise, especially coming from a country where it only rains in the summer. I struggled with both the weather and the cold. What also stood out to me was how people in Ireland carry on with their daily routines regardless of the bad weather.</p>
<p>After completing my Fellowship and returning home, I had the opportunity to come back to Ireland to pursue a PhD in Marketing and International Business. I was fortunate to receive a fully funded scholarship from Research Ireland, which provided the perfect opportunity to continue my studies. I had always aspired to take my education as far as possible, and when the chance arose, I eagerly embraced the challenge and applied. Now in my third year of the PhD programme, I also work part-time as an Associate Lecturer at Griffith College Cork and as an Academic Tutor at MTU Cork. I feel privileged to apply the skills I gained during my master's to lecture and tutor undergraduate students in the Department of Marketing and International Business at my alma mater, helping them with their project work.</p>
<p>My learning experience at MTU Cork has opened numerous doors for me. Through valuable interactions with staff, I received career advice that guided me toward applying for my PhD scholarship. Now in my third year of the PhD, I attribute much of my success to the connections and referrals provided by my network. The master's programme was instrumental in refining my skills, teaching me how to create digital media content such as podcasts, and how to edit audio, images, and videos using the Adobe suite. My writing also greatly improved due to the hands-on, practical writing experience I gained during the programme. These skills have been invaluable in both my research work and my part-time roles as a lecturer and academic tutor.</p>
<p>I am currently torn between pursuing a career in academia or business consulting, as I am equally passionate about both paths. What I do know is that I want to be in a position where I can make a meaningful difference in the world—whether through teaching and mentoring young people or professionals from underserved communities. My goal is to empower others by providing access to quality education, just as I have been fortunate to receive. I also have several ideas I hope to bring to life in the future—so stay tuned! Ultimately, I strive to bring the African proverb 'If you educate a woman, you educate a nation' to life through my work.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the Ireland Fellows Programme to any African professional, as it offers a unique opportunity for career advancement. I have witnessed firsthand how the programme has transformed lives for the better—mine included—and I cannot emphasise enough how impactful this initiative by the Irish people is to its global beneficiaries. Every alumnus of the Ireland Fellows Programme carries fond memories of their time in Ireland, and we all recognise the vital role ICOS played in helping us navigate the significant transition from our home countries to Ireland. To anyone considering applying, I say go for it—you’ll be amazed at how much your life can change!</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to reach out to other Fellows for tips and advice—I gained a lot from doing this. Take full advantage of the opportunity to network, make lifelong friends, seek mentorship, and travel! Additionally, it is important to recognise that moving to Ireland is a significant transition. For many of us, especially those who have never been away from home for extended periods, homesickness is inevitable. If you are struggling, do not hesitate to ask for help—reach out to your school’s counselling services and be open with others about what you are going through. It is a completely normal response and seeking support will help you get through this tough period. You will be surprised at how many other Fellows are experiencing the same thing. And most importantly, enjoy the experience! Ireland is a beautiful country with even more beautiful people, so embrace the moments and explore!</p>
